	- So we’ve conducted some research with over 2,000 female and male **A-Level** and university students to better understand **why so few females are choosing technology careers and what action can be taken.**
	- So what is **putting females off**? Our research shows **there are two key factors at play**.
	- Many females aren’t considering technology as a career, **partly because nobody is putting it forward as a possible option for them**. 
	- **A lack of advice** in schools on technology careers **leaves girls with little understanding of what working in technology involves.**

	- Men’s captions **were rated higher on average than** women’s captions, but only by 0.11 points **out of a perfect score of 5.0**. The researchers also found that **unfunny captions were** **more often wrongly attributed to women** and **funny ones wrongly attributed to men**.
	- When women do enter, however, they **tend to win with fewer attempts compared to men**.
	---

    - Plant-based meat has been **gaining popularity** in China, **as evidenced by** the increasing number of options available in the market. The artificial meat is made from **extracted proteins** from different plants, and **has been associated with healthy eating and sustainability** as these products **require fewer resources to produce compared to raising livestock.**
    - Earlier in April 2020, major **food-and-beverage chains** partnered with US plant-based meat company, Beyond Meat, **to offer time-limited plant-based food** in China. 
    - In July, Beyond Meat worked with a **grocery retail chain**,  to sell its plant-based meat hamburgers in 50 of the **latter’s stores** in Shanghai. 
    - More **vegetarian dishes** with plant-based meat in Shanghai restaurants have been sold in recent years. Zhang Lin, **executive director of a sustainability advisory firm**, says that from this we can see China is a market with huge potential for plant-based meat companies. “
    - The **recent surge of** plant-based meat is a good sign for the environment, but I don’t think companies should make ‘environmentally friendly’ as **the only selling point** for their products,” she says. “**Texture, taste and safety are the basic requirements for all foods, and  plant-based meat is no exception** .”

    - Up to half of the food the world produces **is never eaten**. It is thrown away. Experts say food is wasted in both developed and less-developed countries, but for different reasons. Elliot Woolley teaches about **sustainable manufacturing** at Loughborough University in Britain. He spoke at the Global Conference on Sustainable Manufacturing, held in Vietnam.
    - Mr. Woolley said, in less-developed countries, food is usually lost **while it is still in the field** or **during storage and transportation**. This is because food producers there are **inefficient**, and the businesses are **unable to operate effectively without wasting materials, time, or energy**. But he added that once food is sold in less-developed countries, people usually eat everything they buy.
    - However, people in some developed countries **throw away as much as half of the food they purchase**. The British researcher called this custom “**a disgrace**.” Woolley has created a smartphone app called the “**Pantry** App” which shows users what food they have bought and when the food **is about to become unsafe to eat**. It also gives information on how people can **combine the foods they have to make a meal**.

	- Everything we eat is **a reflection of** **who we are**. There has been quite a bit of research on finding a link between one’s **personality type** and their **food choice**. It seems that **certain traits in our personality** make us more likely to develop a specific eating habit.
	- Back in the 1970s, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania did a study in a village in Mexico. He argued that people enjoy the **burning sensation of spicy food** for the same reason as some people enjoy **potentially** **dangerous activities**.
	- In 2005, **a study was conducted to determine** **personality type** of the participants and **examine their behaviors**, including eating habits. The study showed that **conscientious people** tended to eat more **fruits and vegetables**, and choose overall **healthier meals**. **Extroverts** were shown to **be more prone to** **risky behavior** and **unhealthier food choice**.
	- Another interesting study published in the **Appetite journal** recently found that **extroverts** have a preference toward **fatty**, **savory** and **sweet foods**, as well as **sugary soft drinks**. These are just a few interesting studies that have shown some links between a person’s personality type and their food choices.

	- The book covers a wide range of topics, including **local cooking tools**, **seasonings**, and **recipes of 200 popular Sichuan dishes** from **street snacks** to **banquet dishes**, **country-style dishes**, and **home-made food**.
	- Falling in love with Sichuan food, she spent three months studying it at a local cooking school, while visiting local restaurants, **street stalls**, and **greasy spoons**.
	- Dunlop said that **Sichuan food** meant a whole lot to her. Through studying and cooking, she **accumulated much experience**, **met new friends**, and had a better understanding of **China’s culture and history**. Most importantly, she has tasted **a host of delicacies**.
	---
	- When it comes to food, **color is money**, because “**better stem and fruit color** gives better prices.” Color is judged by a lot of different standards **all along the food chain**. The hue of **orange juice**, for example, **is carefully calibrated by** the United States Department of Agriculture’s Orange Juice Color Standards.
	- Oranges and berries are just the beginning. The color-matching company Munsell sells color standards for food like **French fries**, tomatoes, **pumpkins**, **honey**, and **cherries**. The manager of the company says that a product like the **maraschino cherry** actually has two color standards: One for the cherry after it is **bleached to a pale yellow**, and the other for that **red**.
	- The attention to color is not just for show: Our eyes are arguably the most important **gustatory organ**. As an Oxford University professor points out, more than half of the **cortex** in the brain **is dedicated to processing vision**. The result shows that color **does not just flavor our expectations**; it actually changes the taste of food. 
	- In a 1980 study, **subjects were blindfolded and asked to tell** whether the **beverage** they were drinking was orange. Only one in five could. But when they were allowed to see what they were drinking, each of them **identified the orange flavor**. More than that, **the path from color to taste can go in both directions**. An article in the Journal of **Dairy** Science notes that consumers want cheese that tastes good, but when **likable flavor attributes are missing**, say, in low-fat cheese, the attention of consumers can be drawn to the color of the cheese. **If the color is not right, the sales will decrease.**
	---
	- There is an old saying: “**You are what you eat**.” When we eat the right foods, we feel better **physically**. But what we eat can also make us feel better **emotionally** and **mentally**.
	- **To keep an emotional and mental balance**, one of the important foods is fat. The brain is made up of chemicals that **talk to each other** and that **are lubricated by** the fat in order to communicate across the **synapses**. Healthy fats contribute to our ability **to focus, to pay attention, and to lift our mood**. For example, Omega 3 fatty acids are helpful in treating depression and anxiety.
	- But eating healthy fats is not enough. We also need to eat foods that **break down the fats**, like **dark green vegetables**. These vegetables can **help our liver break down the fats**, which are then **absorbed into the blood stream** and **support brain function**.
	- That's why many health experts say we need to eat **a rainbow of foods** — in other words, **vegetables of all colors**. Orange and  yellow foods provide lots of **vitamin A** and lots of **vital nutrients**. A variety of **greens** are very good for our **digestion**. **Purple** foods and **red foods** are very **anti-inflammatory**. Those are **eggplants** and **berries**.
